/*
 * xllm executor contract: "the model's hands".
 *
 * Pure type seam, no behavior. xllm defines the contract; an implementation
 * (tool registry, permission gate, process table) lives above this library —
 * xwork provides the reference implementation via xworkExecutorBind(). The
 * bounded round-trip loop that drives this contract is xllmSessionRunWithTools
 * in xllm-session; hosts with their own policy drive it manually.
 *
 * Wiring rule: the host composes (executor borrows its owner; the caller of
 * pExecute borrows the executor). Compile-time dependencies never invert:
 * implementations include this header, xllm never includes them.
